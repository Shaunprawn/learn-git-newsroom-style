Hey Everyone,

It's the time of year again for Paws at the Pumpkin Patch!

This year, the undefeated champion for 2-years running, Ms MacPlushin will be strutting down the aisle for the last year. She will be letting her fur down after this to let others dominate. 

Can't make it this year? Just come down for the next cat show in February, My Furry Valentine! 

See you then!
